    - name : "Teaching Assistant for Probabilistic Methods in Eng. "
      company : "with Dr. Horst Hohberger @SJTU"
      duration : "2021 Feb - "
      content : "Probability theory and statistics is interesting, important but often misunderstood. From a wonderful piecs of data one can draw non-sense conclusion if probabalistic methods are not used in the right way. While dealing with computer security, it's important that we can come to a conclusion that sensitive data is \"almost impossible\" to leak. <br>
