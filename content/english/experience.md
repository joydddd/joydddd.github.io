    - name : "Teaching Assistant for Probabilistic Methods in Eng. "
      company : "with <a href=\"https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/faculty-detail/91/\">Dr. Horst Hohberger</a> @SJTU"
      duration : "2021 Feb - 2021 Apr"
      content : "Probability theory and statistics is interesting, important but often misunderstood. From a wonderful piecs of data one can draw non-sense conclusion if probabalistic methods are not used in the right way. While dealing with computer security, it's important that we can come to a conclusion that sensitive data is \"almost impossible\" to leak. <br>
