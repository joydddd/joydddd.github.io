Greetings from Joy! Welcome to my page. My Chinese name Juechu (pronounced ge Ã¼ e, chu) is hard to pronounce even for a Chinese speaker, so you might as well call me Joy.ðŸ˜Š <br>
I don't know which part of the world you're visiting my page from, but I've probably been there or want to visit. The title picture above was taken during my trip to Budapest. I enjoy different culture and life styles. I think book stores, free markets and cofes are best places in a city or town. <br>
I study computer architecture and security. I want to help to make computers run faster but safer with your privacy protected. <br>
Program in: c/c++ (sys)verilog <br>
Speak: English Chinese (a little bit of)German
