Greetings from Joy! Welcome to my page. My Chinese name Juechu (pronounced ge Ã¼ e, chu) is hard to pronounce, so you might as well call me Joy.ðŸ˜Š <br>
I don't know which part of the world you're visiting my page from, but I've probably been there or am willing to visit. The title picture above was taken during my trip to Budapest. It's one of my favorate cities in the world. I'm now living in Ann Arbor, a small town in Michigan. I enjoy different culture and life styles. I think book stores, free markets and cofes are the best places in a town and you can really know the place by visiting them. <br>
I study computer architecture at the University of Michigan. I want to help to make computers run faster but safer with your privacy protected. <br>
Program in: c/c++ (sys)verilog <br>
Speak: English Chinese (a little bit of)German
