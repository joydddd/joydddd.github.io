Greetings from Joy! Welcome to my page. My Chinese name Juechu (pronounced ge Ã¼ e, chu) is hard to pronounce, so you might as well call me Joy.ðŸ˜Š <br>
I don't know which part of the world you're visiting my page from, but I've probably been there or am looking forward to visiting. The title picture above was taken during my trip to Budapest. It's one of my favorate cities in the world. I'm now living in Ann Arbor, a college town in Michigan. I enjoy different culture and life styles. I think book stores, free markets and cafÃ©s are the best places in town and you can really know the place by visiting them. <br>
I'm a 1st year PhD student and I do research in compuater architecture and systems, especially privacy preserving systems. I want to help to make computers run faster and safely with your privacy protected. <br>
Program in: c/c++ cuda (system)verilog <br>
Speak: English Chinese (a little bit of)German
