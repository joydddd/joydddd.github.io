Greetings from Joy! Welcome to my page. My Chinese name is 董珏初 Juechu (pronounced ge ü e, chew), and I'm totally fine with Joy.😊 <br>
I'm a 2nd year PhD student advised by <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~nsatish/">Prof. Satish Narayanasamy</a> in the <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on computer architecture and systems, especially privacy enhancing topics. I seek to advance confidential computing solutions for enabling privacy-preserving data analytics solutions ranging from population scale genomic analysis to generative AI. My current work focuses on scaling trusted memory capacity from hundreds of MB to tens of TB and developing privacy-preserving genome-wide association study platform on Azure's confidential computing platform. <br>
