- Book stores, free markets and cafÃ©s are my must-visits while traveling. My recent best is Campfire Coffee, Negaunee, MI, in a tiny town near Marquette, upper Peninsula. Nice place to visit in fall. 
- Shanghai has only two seasons, winter and summer, and they switch randomly. It is otherwise a wonderful city to live in.
