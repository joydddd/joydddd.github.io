- Book stores, free markets and caf√©s are my must-visits while traveling. My recent best is Campfire Coffee, Negaunee, MI, in a tiny town near Marquette, upper Peninsula. Nice place to visit in fall. 
- Shanghai has only two seasons, winter and summer, and they switch randomly. It is otherwise a wonderful city to live in. 
- My source of metal support: food, friends, IKEA sharks and my cat Marie. 
- Best thing happened recently: I got a really good book about Hapsburg history on the street from a weird old man.
